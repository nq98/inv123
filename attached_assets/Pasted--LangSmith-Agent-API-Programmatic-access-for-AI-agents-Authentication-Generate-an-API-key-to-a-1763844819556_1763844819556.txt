🔒 Security
Tenant Isolation: API keys are scoped to a single client_id. You can only access your own data.
API Key Storage: Keys are hashed with bcrypt. The raw key is only shown once during generation.
Rate Limiting: Coming soon - implement rate limiting in your application if needed.
HTTPS Only: Always use HTTPS in production to protect API keys in transit.
